# HarmonyHub: Logistics Optimization Made Simple

Welcome to **HarmonyHub**, the ultimate solution for logistics optimization in the world of musical instruments. This application is designed to efficiently manage and optimize the transportation of delicate, fragile, and often cumbersome musical instruments across various locations using a fleet of different-sized trucks.

## 🎶 Overview

**HarmonyHub** uses advanced constraint programming techniques to ensure that your musical instruments are transported safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively. The application considers multiple factors, such as:

- **Truck Size and Capacity**: We offer a fleet of small, medium, and large trucks to cater to different volumes and weights.
- **Instrument Fragility and Stackability**: We ensure that fragile instruments are handled with care and that stackable instruments are efficiently packed.
- **Optimal Routes**: Our model minimizes the total distance traveled, reducing fuel consumption and delivery time.

## 🚚 Features

1. **Simulate Orders**: Generate and visualize random orders based on real-world data, including the type of instrument, dimensions, weight, and destination.
2. **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust the number of orders, probability of express delivery, and destination cities to match your specific logistics needs.
3. **Optimization with OR-Tools**: Leverage the power of Google's OR-Tools to solve complex logistics problems, ensuring the most efficient use of your fleet.
4. **Detailed KPIs**: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like total distance traveled, average distance per order, and overall truck utilization.
5. **Interactive UI**: Explore different solutions and scenarios through an intuitive Streamlit interface, with expandable solution details for in-depth analysis.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Simulate Data**: Start by generating a set of random orders. These orders will include various instruments, their dimensions, and their destinations, based on predefined parameters.
   
2. **Run Optimization**: After simulating the orders, run the optimization model. The model assigns each order to a specific truck, determines the optimal route for each truck, and handles stacking constraints.
   
3. **View Results**: Examine the solutions generated by the optimization model. You'll get a detailed view of how each truck is loaded, the sequence of deliveries, and any stacking considerations.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/harmonyhub.git
   cd harmonyhub
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Musical Instrument Retailers**: Optimize your delivery routes and truck usage, ensuring instruments arrive safely and on time.
- **Event Planners**: Efficiently manage the logistics of transporting musical equipment to event locations.
- **Logistics Companies**: Integrate HarmonyHub into your existing logistics systems to handle special cargo that requires extra care.

## 🛠️ Customization

Want to adapt HarmonyHub to your specific needs? The code is fully customizable. You can tweak the parameters, add more truck types, or even include additional constraints like delivery time windows or variable fuel costs.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

We're committed to continuous improvement. Planned features include:

- **Real-time traffic integration**: Adjust routes based on real-time traffic data.
- **Enhanced UI**: More interactive visualizations for truck routes and loading plans.
- **Multi-depot Optimization**: For more complex logistics scenarios.

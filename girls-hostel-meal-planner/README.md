### Problem Statement: Advanced Dietary Supply Chain Optimizer

#### Background:
In institutions such as hostels, hospitals, or large community centers in India, managing dietary requirements for a large number of individuals with diverse dietary needs presents a significant challenge. These institutions must not only meet the nutritional requirements of each individual but also manage costs, inventory, and logistical constraints effectively.

#### Objective:
Develop an "Advanced Dietary Supply Chain Optimizer" that integrates various factors such as dietary requirements, inventory levels, purchase frequencies, transportation costs, and a planning horizon to ensure an efficient, cost-effective, and nutritionally adequate food supply.

#### Specific Goals:

1. **Nutritional Requirements**:
   - Ensure each diet type (e.g., Vegan, Vegetarian, NonVegetarian, Low Carb, High Protein) meets specific minimum protein and maximum carbohydrate needs.
   - Each diet plan should include at least five different food sources to ensure dietary diversity.

2. **Inventory Management**:
   - Define and maintain optimal inventory levels with defined minimum and maximum thresholds to prevent overstocking and understocking.
   - Calculate minimum and maximum quantities to be purchased for each food item based on the number of people, ensuring efficient use of storage and minimal waste.

3. **Logistical Constraints**:
   - Include vehicle capacity constraints to ensure that delivery loads are within the limits of transportation means.
   - Factor in transportation costs, which depend on the distance to the market and the frequency of trips, to minimize overall logistics costs.

4. **Purchase Frequency and Planning Horizon**:
   - Optimize the frequency of purchasing to balance fresh supply with minimal trips, reducing costs and managing storage efficiently.
   - Set a planning horizon (ranging from 1 to 12 months) to forecast and plan the supply chain over a significant period, adapting to seasonal variations and consumption patterns.

5. **Unit Conversion and Consistency**:
   - Ensure all units (protein, carbs, cost, volume) are consistent and relevant, preferably using metric units (e.g., kilograms) to align with local usage and comprehension.
   - Protein and carbohydrate values should be considered per kilogram to facilitate straightforward calculations and inventory management.

#### Implementation:
The solution will be implemented using a combination of Python for backend calculations (using libraries such as PuLP for linear programming optimization) and Streamlit for the frontend interface. This approach allows users to interactively modify parameters, run optimizations, and view results in real time. The backend will handle complex computations, considering all constraints and objectives, and return optimized recommendations for purchasing, inventory levels, and delivery schedules.

#### Expected Outcomes:
The optimizer will provide detailed guidance on:
- How much of each food item to purchase.
- How to maintain inventory levels.
- When to schedule deliveries.
- Potential cost savings in transportation and purchasing.
- Ensuring nutritional adequacy across different diet types.

This system aims to streamline dietary management in large-scale operations, reduce operational stress related to dietary logistics, and improve overall efficiency and satisfaction among the individuals served.

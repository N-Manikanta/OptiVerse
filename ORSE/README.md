### Problem Description:
Given the equation:
\[ 280a + 80b + 75c + 50d + 25e - 30f - 42g = R \]
where \( a, b, c, d, e, f, g \) are strictly positive integer modifiers, and \( R \) is the solution range, your goal is to find the smallest sum of modifiers for each possible subset such that the equation result is within the given range.

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Define the problem and variables**:
   - You have seven variables \( a, b, c, d, e, f, g \).
   - Each subset will include only some of these variables (i.e., some will be set to zero).

2. **Formulate the constraints**:
   - The equation must be within the range \( R \), which you've set as -2 to -2 in the example.
   - The subset of variables you consider will be non-zero; all others should be set to zero.

3. **Objective**:
   - Minimize the sum of the non-zero variables for each subset.

4. **Modeling in OR-Tools**:
   - For each subset of \( a, b, c, d, e, f, g \), create a constraint programming model.
   - Define the equation and objective for each subset.
   - Use OR-Tools to solve the problem and retrieve the minimal solution.
